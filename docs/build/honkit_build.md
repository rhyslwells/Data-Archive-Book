do you need to do:

npx honkit build

before 
npx honkit epub ./ ./data-archive-book.epub


ChatGPT said:
Yes, you typically need to run npx honkit build before npx honkit epub in the build process for a few reasons:

Build Process: The npx honkit build command generates the necessary static files from your Markdown files. It processes your content, applies themes, and builds the HTML files that are used for the EPUB creation. If you try to run npx honkit epub without first running the build, you might get an incomplete or missing HTML structure, resulting in an invalid or empty EPUB file.

Output Directory: When you run npx honkit build, it generates an output directory (e.g., _book or similar) that contains the processed files. The npx honkit epub command will take those processed HTML files and use them to create the EPUB file. If the build step hasn't been completed, honkit epub won't have the necessary files to create the EPUB.

So, the typical sequence is:

Run the build: This generates the necessary HTML files and other resources.

bash
Copy
Edit
npx honkit build
Run the EPUB build: This creates the EPUB file from the generated HTML files.

bash
Copy
Edit
npx honkit epub ./ ./data-archive-book.epub
Summary of the Process:
npx honkit build: Transforms your Markdown files into HTML and other static assets.

npx honkit epub: Converts the generated HTML (from the build step) into an EPUB file.

Make sure you have completed the build step before attempting the EPUB step. If you haven't run build, the epub command won't have the required files to generate a valid EPUB.
