# Notes Compiler

This project compiles a collection of markdown notes into a well-formatted EPUB file using Pandoc, with custom styling applied. The resulting EPUB file is ideal for e-readers like Kobo or Kindle, making it easier to organize and read data archives, research notes, or other types of written content.

- For my use case, I take these notes from the [Data Archive](https://rhyslwells.github.io/Data-Archive/), which are written using Obsidian.


## Features

- Converts markdown files into an EPUB format.
- Supports custom CSS styling for EPUB formatting.
- Generates a table of contents (ToC) for easy navigation.
- Automatically cleans up YAML front matter from markdown files before compiling.
