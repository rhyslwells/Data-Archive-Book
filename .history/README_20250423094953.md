This project turns the [Data Archive](https://rhyslwells.github.io/Data-Archive/) into a book (EPUB/PDF). Please note that this is a work in progress and the pdf/epub files will be periodically updated when significant changes are made to the Data Archive. The book is created using [Honkit](https://honkit.netlify.app/).

For commands on how to create the book see the [Build.md](docs/build/Build.md) file.

For current issues and future work see the [Issues](docs/issues/ongoing_issues.md) file.
