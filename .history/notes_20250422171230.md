# Notes

3. Initialize a Book Project
Create a new directory for your book:

bash
Copy code
mkdir mybook
cd mybook
honkit init

5. Serve the Book Locally
Launch a development server to preview the content in the browser:

bash
Copy code
honkit serve
Open http://localhost:4000 to view your book.


7. Export to PDF/ePub/Mobi (Optional)
Install Calibre’s CLI (ebook-convert) first, then:

bash
Copy code
honkit pdf ./ ./mybook.pdf
honkit epub ./ ./mybook.epub

Katex works
npm install gitbook-plugin-include-codeblock --save-dev


resources:
https://github.com/honkit/honkit/issues/217

npm install gitbook-plugin-katex --save-dev


npx honkit build
npx honkit pdf ./ ./data-archive-book.pdf
npx honkit epub ./ ./data-archive-book.epub

To configure images from obsidian to honkit formats
python update_image_links.py

python update_file_links.py
internal links of form:

[Logistic Regression](./Logistic%20Regression.html)


## Honkit

```
cd DAB
npx DAB epub ./ ./book.epub
```

## Issues

Fix these:
- latex 
  - This show latex:https://www.algorithm-archive.org/contents/verlet_integration/verlet_integration.html
- images

Later issues
- Add relative paths instead of absolute paths.
- Would be good to have all [[links]] linking within the epub file.
- Add a way to have images in the markdown files and have them show up in the epub file. Would need to add paths [[]]to the images in the markdown files and then have the script copy them to the output directory (of the form ![[Pasted image 20241219071904.png]]).
-Add a cover

# Issue current 

Why does
this produce a pdf with images
npx honkit pdf ./ ./data-archive-book.pdf

but does not show images?
npx honkit epub ./ ./data-archive-book.epub

This uses Calibre's ebook-convert under the hood to build the EPUB. However:

HonKit does not automatically copy image files into the EPUB build

Image links like ![](./images/foo.png) fail silently if those files are not included

EPUBs require images to be embedded inside the final .epub ZIP bundle — relative paths will not resolve to your filesystem after export


The vscode epub viwer its bad use calibre to view the epub file.
