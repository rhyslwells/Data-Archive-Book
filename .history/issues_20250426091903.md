# Ongoing Issues

- Latex does not properly render for some $$\Latex$$, and also not for $\LaTeX$ format.

# Resolved Issues

Issue 1: For all files in the Data-Archive (7550 files) the I/O process for honkit build is slow.

Attempt 1: Reduce the number of files to build by grouping alphapetically, with a local TOC for each group. This did not allow the internal links to work between groupings.

Attempt 2: Flatten all files into a single file. This worked for the internal links, but broke the EPUB output due to the large single file structure. The KaTeX math rendering failed due to the {% raw %} / {% math %} tags being left untouched. Tried to use a plugin like `honkit-plugin-chapterize` but the install failed and the plugin is not available in the honkit plugin repository.

Issue 2: For epub the images are not showing up in the final output.
- Resolution: For epub format images need to within contents/images folder. We also udate images links within notes to be relative to the contents folder. This is done in the `update.py` script.

Issue 3: The highlighted text syntax `==highlighted text==` is not natively supported by HonKit.
- Resolution: We can preprocess the Markdown files to convert this into HTML, convert `==...==` to `<mark>...</mark>`.

Images in epub:
- For epub to view images correctly, the images need to be in the same directory contents,not the same as pdf generation.
- The vscode epub viwer its bad use calibre to view the epub file.
- Honkit uses calibre to create the epub file.
