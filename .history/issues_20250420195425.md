## Honkit

```
cd DAB
npx DAB epub ./ ./book.epub
```

## Issues

Fix these:
- latex 
  - This show latex:https://www.algorithm-archive.org/contents/verlet_integration/verlet_integration.html
- images

Later issues
- Add relative paths instead of absolute paths.
- Would be good to have all [[links]] linking within the epub file.
- Add a way to have images in the markdown files and have them show up in the epub file. Would need to add paths [[]]to the images in the markdown files and then have the script copy them to the output directory (of the form ![[Pasted image 20241219071904.png]]).
