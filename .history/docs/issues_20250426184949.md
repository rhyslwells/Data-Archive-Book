Excellent. Here’s a suggested structured and standardized format to further improve clarity and maintainability of your notes:

# Ongoing Issues

## Issue 5: Unsupported Code Blocks Cause Build Failures

- **Problem:** HonKit does not support certain non-standard code block types.
- **Attempt 5.1:**  
  Preprocess Markdown files to **remove** unsupported blocks:
  - `mermaid`
  - `bandit`
  - `dataview`
  - `just`
  - `dv`
  - `output`
- **Status:** Ongoing

# Resolved Issues

## Issue 7: Inline $ \LaTeX $ Not Rendering Properly

- **Problem:** Inline $ \LaTeX $ expressions (`$...$`) are not correctly rendered.
- **Resolution 7.1:**  
  Use `latex.py` to **convert** `$term$` to `$$term$$`.

## Issue 6: KaTeX Does Not Render $ \dots $

- **Problem:** KaTeX fails to render `\dots` correctly in EPUB output.
- **Resolution 6.1:**  
  - Find and **delete problematic entries** from `book.md`.
  - Then run: `python main.py --run latex.py`.

## Issue 4: Slow Build Performance for EPUB with Many Files

- **Problem:** Building EPUB with too many files slows down and sometimes fails.
- **Resolution 4.1:**  
  - In `main.py`, **selectively copy** only necessary files to `content/` before build.
  - **Reduces** the total number of processed files.

## Issue 3: Slow I/O During HonKit Build (7,550 Files)

- **Problem:** Full dataset processing is too slow.
- **Attempt 3.1:**  
  Group files alphabetically with local TOCs.  
  → **Internal links broke** across groups.
- **Attempt 3.2:**  
  Flatten files into a **single large file**.  
  → **Internal links worked**, but:
  - EPUB generation failed due to file size.
  - KaTeX rendering broke (`{% raw %}` / `{% math %}` left intact).
  - Plugin `honkit-plugin-chapterize` installation attempt **failed** (plugin unavailable).

## Issue 2: Images Not Displaying in EPUB

- **Problem:** Images missing in final EPUB output.
- **Resolution 2.1:**  
  - Move images into `contents/images/`.
  - Update Markdown image links to relative paths:
    ```
    ![Image](images/filename.png)
    ```
  - Implemented within `update.py`.

**Notes:**
- EPUB image handling differs from PDF generation.
- **Use Calibre** for EPUB viewing (not VSCode's viewer).
- HonKit uses Calibre to build EPUBs internally.

## Issue 1: Highlighted Text Not Supported

- **Problem:** HonKit does not support `==highlighted text==` syntax.
- **Resolution 1.1:**  
  Preprocess Markdown to **convert** `==...==` into `<mark>...</mark>` tags.
