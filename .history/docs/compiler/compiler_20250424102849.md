I have

$$\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$

But when i run npx pub ect:

I get something like this:

{% raw %}    $$Z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}$$
{% endraw %}

table of contnats only showing the first H1 header.

Why HonKit still ignores later H1s
HonKit (GitBook 3) builds the EPUB TOC from one markdown file per chapter.
Because you merge every note into a single book.md, HonKit sees only the first H1 inside that file; the rest are treated as plain text. (Internally it converts each source file to one HTML “chapter” and uses the first H‑tag it finds.)

Rule: One heading per source file becomes a TOC entry.
