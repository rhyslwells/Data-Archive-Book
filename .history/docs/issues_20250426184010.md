# Ongoing Issues

- Latex does not properly render for some $$\Latex$$, and also not for $\LaTeX$ format.
- Revisit Issue 5.

# Resolved Issues

## Issues 6: Katex does not render \dots
- Resolution: find and delete issues from book.md before running 
python main.py --run latex.py   


## Issue 5: Code blocks fail to run for non standard code blocks.
  
- Atttempt 5.1: We can preprocess the Markdown files to remove the code blocks that are not supported by HonKit, and removes the following code blocks:
  - `mermaid`
  - `bandit`
  - `dataview`
  - `just`
  - `dv`
  - `output`


## Issue 4: Building epub that contain a lot of files can be slow and cause issues with the build process. The build process can take a long time to complete, and in some cases, it may even fail due to the large number of files being processed.

- Resolution: In main.py we selectively copy files to the content folder based on the selected files. This reduces the number of files that need to be processed during the build process.

## Issue 3: For all files in the Data-Archive (7550 files) the I/O process for honkit build is slow.

Attempt 3.1: Reduce the number of files to build by grouping alphapetically, with a local TOC for each group. This did not allow the internal links to work between groupings.

Attempt 3.2: Flatten all files into a single file. This worked for the internal links, but broke the EPUB output due to the large single file structure. The KaTeX math rendering failed due to the {% raw %} / {% math %} tags being left untouched. Tried to use a plugin like `honkit-plugin-chapterize` but the install failed and the plugin is not available in the honkit plugin repository.

## Issue 2: For epub the images are not showing up in the final output.

- Resolution: For epub format images need to within contents/images folder. We also udate images links within notes to be relative to the contents folder. This is done in the `update.py` script. Corrects image links ![]() - to the following format 
![Pasted image 20240124095916.png](images/Pasted%20image%2020240124095916.png)

Images in epub:
- For epub to view images correctly, the images need to be in the same directory contents,not the same as pdf generation.
- The vscode epub viwer its bad use calibre to view the epub file.
- Honkit uses calibre to create the epub file.

## Issue 1: The highlighted text syntax `==highlighted text==` is not natively supported by HonKit.

- Resolution: We can preprocess the Markdown files to convert this into HTML, convert `==...==` to `<mark>...</mark>`.
