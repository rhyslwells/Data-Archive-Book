
links Issue 2: Just group everything together

see compiler.py

These links only working within the grouped file. A.md ect, for the link #api but links to #reggression (note in R.md) do not go to the R.md heading


---
Solution: use inject.py

I want to fix the internal links witihin my epub. In A.md in grouped folder i have this. The table of contents links at the top work, but the internal ones i.e. AB testing in Acid transaction do not link me to the ab testing note.

# A

## Table of Contents
* [AB testing](#ab-testing)
* [ACID Transaction](#acid-transaction)
* [AI Engineer](#ai-engineer)
* [AI governance](#ai-governance)
* [Azure](#azure)ect
