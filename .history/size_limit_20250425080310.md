Certainly — here’s a concise summary of the recent issue and its context:

---

### ❗️Problem

- You want to **flatten multiple Markdown notes into a single file** (`book.md`) to enable **internal links** (e.g. `[see this](#some-anchor)`).
- However, this flattened structure **breaks EPUB output**:
  - KaTeX math rendering fails due to `{% raw %}` / `{% math %}` tags being left untouched.
  - EPUB readers sometimes **ignore** internal section links within one large file.
  - EPUB TOC generated from `SUMMARY.md` may not map correctly to intra-document anchors.

---

### ✅ What Works

- The `grouping.py` version:
  - Groups files by first letter, outputs one file per letter (e.g., `A.md`, `B.md`).
  - Generates EPUB-compatible TOC and sectioning.
  - Keeps math in raw `$$` format and avoids template fences — so EPUB renders correctly.
- `compiler.py`:
  - Flattens all notes into a single file with a synthetic "Preface" and full `book.md`.
  - Works for internal Markdown links, **but breaks EPUB** due to math fences and large single-file structure.

### ✅ Resolution Strategy

- ✅ **Flattening is OK** if:
  - You **strip `{% math %}` and `{% raw %}` wrappers** and just use `$$...$$` or `$...$`.
  - You **insert manual HTML page breaks** between sections:  
    `<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>`
  - You generate unique `# Heading {#anchor}` for internal navigation and TOC compatibility.
- ✅ Optionally use a plugin like `honkit-plugin-chapterize` to split large Markdown logically for EPUB, while keeping a flattened logical structure for links.

Let me know if you'd like me to rewrite or patch your `compiler.py` with the fixes.
