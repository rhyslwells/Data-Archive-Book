
- Note all notes are becoming pages.
  - think we are creating master note first, then looking for H1 headers, which is not the best way to do this.

## Fixes to be made

- Add relative paths instead of absolute paths.
- Would be good to have all [[links]] linking within the epub file.
- Add a way to have images in the markdown files and have them show up in the epub file. Would need to add paths [[]]to the images in the markdown files and then have the script copy them to the output directory (of the form ![[Pasted image 20241219071904.png]]).
