# Data-Archive-Book-Builder

The **Data-Archive-Book-Builder** transforms selected content from the [Data Archive](https://rhyslwells.github.io/Data-Archive/) into **PDF** and **EPUB** formats using [HonKit](https://honkit.netlify.app/).

It enables users to **select specific Markdown files** to compile into **focused, modular books**.  
This supports research workflows by creating smaller, topic-specific collections, which can be used independently or integrated into tools like **NotebookLM** for deeper exploration.

## Why This Matters

- Curated books can be passed into tools like **NotebookLM** to summarize, refine, and explore research topics more efficiently.
- Modular compilation reduces cognitive overload and makes large, interconnected archives more accessible and actionable.
