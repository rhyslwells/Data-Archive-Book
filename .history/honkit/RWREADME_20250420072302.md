# Notes Compiler

This project compiles a collection of markdown notes into a well-formatted EPUB file using Pandoc, with custom styling applied. The resulting EPUB file is ideal for e-readers like Kobo or Kindle, making it easier to organize and read data archives, research notes, or other types of written content.

- For my use case, I take these notes from the [Data Archive](https://rhyslwells.github.io/Data-Archive/), which are written using Obsidian.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. After you have the prerequisites installed and have cloned the repository. Go to scripts\main.py and insert the path to your markdown files in the `input_dir` variable. Then run the script. 
2. This will create notes.epub in the outputs directory. You can open this file with any EPUB reader.
3. If you want to customize the CSS, you can modify the `style.css` file in the `styles` directory. Then run better_looking.py to create a new EPUB file with the updated CSS. This will create a new file called enhanced_notes.epub in the outputs directory.

## Features

- Converts markdown files into an EPUB format.
- Supports custom CSS styling for EPUB formatting.
- Generates a table of contents (ToC) for easy navigation.
- Automatically cleans up YAML front matter from markdown files before compiling.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that the following tools are installed on your system:

1. **Pandoc** - A document converter used to generate EPUB files. You can install it from [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
2. **Python** - Required for running the script. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Additionally, make sure that the following dependencies are available:
