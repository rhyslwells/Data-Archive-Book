# Unsupervised Learning {#unsupervised-learning}


Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on data without explicit labels or predefined outputs. 

Unsupervised learning involves discovering hidden patterns in data without predefined labels. It is valuable for exploratory data analysis, [Clustering](#clustering), and [Isolated Forest](#isolated-forest).

The goal is to find hidden patterns, relationships, or structures in the data. Unlike supervised learning, which uses labeled input-output pairs, unsupervised learning relies solely on input data, allowing the algorithm to uncover insights independently.

### Key Concepts

1. No Labeled Data: There is no ground truth or correct output associated with the input data.
2. Data Patterns: The algorithm identifies inherent structures, clusters, or associations within the dataset.
3. Objective: The primary objective is to explore the data and organize it to reveal underlying patterns.

### Common Types of Unsupervised Learning

#### [Clustering](#clustering)

Description: The algorithm groups similar data points together based on their features.

Example: Customer segmentation in marketing, where a clustering algorithm divides customers into groups based on purchasing behavior, demographics, or browsing history.

Popular Algorithms:
  - [K-means](#k-means): Divides the data into \( k \) clusters, where each data point belongs to the nearest cluster.
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - [DBScan](#dbscan)
  - [Support Vector Machines](#support-vector-machines)
  - [K-nearest neighbours](#k-nearest-neighbours)

#### [Dimensionality Reduction](#dimensionality-reduction)

Description: Reduces the number of input variables (features) while preserving as much information as possible. This is helpful for high-dimensional data, where visualization and analysis become challenging.

Popular Algorithms:
  - [Principal Component Analysis](#principal-component-analysis) 

#### [Isolated Forest](#isolated-forest)

Description: Identifies [standardised/Outliers](#standardisedoutliers) or unusual data points that don’t conform to the expected pattern in the dataset.

Example: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions by identifying transactions that deviate significantly from typical spending patterns.

Mechanism: Works by randomly partitioning the data and identifying [standardised/Outliers|anomalies](#standardisedoutliersanomalies) as points that can be isolated quickly.

**Training and Optimization (Next Steps)**
The provided code only defines the network and performs a **forward pass**, but to use this model for real-world tasks, you would need to:
- **Define a loss function** (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression or Cross-Entropy Loss for classification).
- **Train the network** using an optimizer like **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**, **Adam**, or another optimization algorithm.
- **Backpropagate** the gradients to update the model’s weights using gradient descent.

# Utilities {#utilities}



# Unittest {#unittest}


### **`@patch` (from `unittest.mock`) Explanation**

`@patch` is used to replace objects/functions with mock versions during tests. It is part of Python’s `unittest.mock` module.

#### **Example & Usage**

python

Copy code

`from unittest.mock import patch  def fetch_data():     """Simulated function that fetches data from an API"""     return "Real Data"  @patch("__main__.fetch_data", return_value="Mocked Data") def test_fetch_data(mock_fetch):     assert fetch_data() == "Mocked Data"`

🔹 **How it works:**

- `@patch("__main__.fetch_data", return_value="Mocked Data")` replaces `fetch_data()` with a mocked version returning `"Mocked Data"`.
- Inside the test, `fetch_data()` will **always** return `"Mocked Data"` instead of calling the real function.

#### **Why use `@patch`?**

- Prevents tests from making actual API/database calls.
- Speeds up testing by mocking expensive operations.
- Allows control over return values and side effects.

---

### **Your Case:**

- **`@pytest.fixture`** is used to provide reusable test data (`mock_files`).
- **`@patch`** is used to:
    - Mock file operations (`builtins.open`, `os.walk`).
    - Mock function calls (`process_file`, `log_action`, `write_updated_file`).
    - Prevent real file modifications while testing.

# Univariate Vs Multivariate {#univariate-vs-multivariate}

Single feature versus multiple features



# Unstructured Data {#unstructured-data}


>[!Important]
> Unstructured data is data that does not conform to a data model and has no easily identifiable structure. 

Unstructured data cannot be easily used by programs, and is difficult to analyze. Examples of unstructured data could be the contents of an ==email, contents of a word document, data from social media, photos, videos, survey results==, etc.
## An example of unstructured data

An simple example of unstructured data is a string that contains interesting information inside of it, but that has not been formatted into a well defined schema. An example is given below:

|               |  **UnstructuredString**|
|---------| -----------|
|Record 1| "Bob is 29" |
|Record 2| "Mary just turned 30"|

## Unstructured vs structured data

In contrast with unstructured data, [structured data](term/structured%20data.md) refers to data that has been formatted into a well-defined schema. An example would be data that is stored with precisely defined columns in a relational database or excel spreadsheet. Examples of structured fields could be age, name, phone number, credit card numbers or address. Storing data in a structured format allows it to be easily understood and queried by machines and with tools such as  [SQL](#sql).
